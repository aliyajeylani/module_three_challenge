# module_three_challenge

## Description

The goal for this challenge is to modify a starter code that enables employees to generate random passwords based on the criteria they have selected. The criteria for generating the password is that it should include a lowercase, uppercase, numeric, or special character. My code will ensure that user is prompted to select at least one character type before generating the password. This will ensure that a strong password is generated to provide greater security.
